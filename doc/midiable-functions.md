#Functions

Applictive functors work like this example: 

	# pan ((*) <$> sinewave1 <*> (slow 8 $ "0 0.25 0.75"))


In the above, the  `sinewave1`  and the  `(slow 8 $ "0 0.25 0.75")`  pattern are multiplied together. Using the `<$>`  and the  `<*>`  in this way turns the  `*` operator, which normally works with two numbers, into a function that instead works on two patterns of numbers.
